## 📝 Important Note About Editor Errors

You may see TypeScript errors in VS Code (like "Property 'div' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'"), but **these are false positives**. The build completes successfully! To fix these editor errors:

**Option 1: Restart VS Code TypeScript Server**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Press Enter

**Option 2: Reload VS Code Window**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter

These errors don't affect the build or publishing process.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Publishing Guide

### Step 1: Customize Package Information

Edit `package.json` and update these fields:

```json
{
  "name": "awesome-components",  // ⚠️ Change if name is taken (see below)
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A modern, lightweight React component library with TypeScript support",
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-components.git"  // ⚠️ Update this
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-components/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-components#readme"
}
```

#### ⚠️ Check Package Name Availability

The name `awesome-components` might already be taken on NPM. Check availability:

```powershell
npm search awesome-components
```

**If the name is taken**, you have two options:

1. **Use a scoped package** (recommended):
   ```json
   "name": "@your-username/awesome-components"
   ```
   Then install with: `npm i @your-username/awesome-components`

2. **Choose a different name**:
   ```json
   "name": "my-awesome-react-components"
   ```

### Step 2: Create NPM Account

If you don't have an NPM account:

1. Go to [https://www.npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
2. Create your account
3. Verify your email

### Step 3: Generate NPM Access Token

1. Login to NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/login](https://www.npmjs.com/login)
2. Click on your profile picture → **Access Tokens**
3. Click **Generate New Token** → **Classic Token**
4. Select **Automation** (for CI/CD publishing)
5. Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)

### Step 4: Setup GitHub Repository

#### 4.1 Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `awesome-components` (or your chosen name)
3. Keep it **public** (required for free NPM publishing)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click **Create repository**

#### 4.2 Add NPM Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste your NPM access token from Step 3
6. Click **Add secret**

### Step 5: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd d:\website\library

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: awesome-components library"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-components.git

# Push to GitHub (this will trigger automatic publishing!)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 6: Automatic Publishing via GitHub Actions

Once you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. ✅ Run tests (`npm test`)
3. ✅ Build the library (`npm run build`)
4. ✅ Bump version (`npm version patch`)
5. ✅ Publish to NPM (`npm publish`)

**Watch the workflow:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. You'll see "Publish to NPM" workflow running
4. Click on it to see the progress

**First publish will be version 0.1.1** (it auto-bumps from 0.1.0)

---

## 🔄 Publishing Updates (After Initial Publish)

For future updates, just commit and push to `main`:

```powershell
# Make your changes to components
# ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature to Button component"

# Push to main (triggers auto-publish with version bump)
git push origin main
```

Each push to `main` will:
- Automatically bump the patch version (0.1.1 → 0.1.2 → 0.1.3...)
- Publish the new version to NPM

---

## 📦 Manual Publishing (Alternative to GitHub Actions)

If you prefer to publish manually without GitHub Actions:

```powershell
# Login to NPM
npm login

# Build the library
npm run build

# Publish to NPM
npm publish

# Or for scoped packages (first time only):
npm publish --access public
```

For subsequent manual publishes, bump the version first:

```powershell
# Bump patch version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
npm version patch

# Publish
npm publish
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Published Package

After publishing, test it in a new project:

```powershell
# Create a test directory
mkdir test-awesome-components
cd test-awesome-components

# Create a new React project
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app

# Install your published package
npm install awesome-components

# Test imports
```

Create a test file `src/App.js`:

```javascript
import { Button, Card, Badge } from 'awesome-components';
import 'awesome-components/styles.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Card title="Test Card" variant="elevated">
        <Button variant="primary">Click Me!</Button>
        <Badge variant="success">New</Badge>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring Your Package

After publishing:

1. **NPM Package Page**: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/awesome-components`
2. **Check downloads**: See stats on your NPM package page
3. **View in NPM search**: `npm search awesome-components`

---

## 🎯 Version Management

Your package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, small tweaks
  ```powershell
  npm version patch
  ```

- **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, backward compatible
  ```powershell
  npm version minor
  ```

- **Major** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes
  ```powershell
  npm version major
  ```

## 🛡️ Pre-Publish Checklist

Before your first publish, verify:

- [ ] Package name is unique or scoped
- [ ] `package.json` has correct author, repository, homepage
- [ ] NPM account created and email verified
- [ ] NPM access token generated
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] `NPM_TOKEN` added to GitHub secrets
- [ ] Build runs successfully: `npm run build`
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] README.md is complete
- [ ] LICENSE file is included

---

## 🎉 Ready to Publish!

Once you complete Step 5 (push to GitHub), your package will be **automatically published** to NPM! 🚀

**Your users will install it with:**
```bash
npm install awesome-components
```

**And use it like:**
```javascript
import { Button, Card, Modal } from 'awesome-components';
import 'awesome-components/styles.css';
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Package name already exists"
- Use a scoped package: `@your-username/awesome-components`
- Or choose a different name

### "401 Unauthorized" during publish
- Check NPM_TOKEN is correctly set in GitHub secrets
- Ensure token has "Automation" permissions
- Token might be expired - generate a new one

### "npm ERR! 403 Forbidden"
- You don't have permission to publish this package name
- The name is already taken by someone else
- Use a scoped package or different name

### Build fails in GitHub Actions
- Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
- Ensure all tests pass locally: `npm test`
- Verify build works locally: `npm run build`

### TypeScript errors in editor (but build succeeds)
- Restart TypeScript server: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
- Or reload VS Code window
- These don't affect the actual build or publishing
